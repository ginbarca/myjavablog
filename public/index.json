You can reference page resources by the value for Resources.GetMatch or the filepath of the resource relative to the page directory directly. Store resources in the assets directory, which is /assets by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the assets directory. Store resources in the static directory, which is /static by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the static directory. The priority of references is also in the above order. There are many places in the theme where the above local resource references can be used, such as links, images, image shortcode, music shortcode and some params in the front matter. Images in page resources or assets directory processing will be supported in the future. It’s really cool!

Tip\rHere is a list of $\\TeX$ functions supported by $\\KaTeX$.\rNote\rSince Hugo generates HTML documents according to the syntax such as _/*/\u003e\u003e when rendering Markdown documents, and some text content in the form of escape characters (such as \\(/\\)/\\[/\\]/\\\\) escape processing will be performed automatically, therefore, additional escape character expressions are required for these places to achieve automatic rendering: _ -\u003e \\_ * -\u003e \\* \u003e\u003e -\u003e \\\u003e\u003e \\( -\u003e \\\\( \\) -\u003e \\\\) \\[ -\u003e \\\\[ \\] -\u003e \\\\] \\\\ -\u003e \\\\\\\\ LoveIt theme supports raw shortcode to avoid these escape characters, which helps you write raw mathematical formula content. Example raw input: Inline Formula: Block Formula: The rendered output looks like this: Inline Formula: Block Formula: Inline Formula The default inline delimiters are: $ ... $ \\( ... \\) (escaped: \\\\( ... \\\\)) For example: $c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ and \\\\(f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d \\xi\\\\) The rendered output looks like this: $c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ and \\(f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d \\xi\\) Block Formula The default block delimiters are: $$ ... $$ \\[ ... \\] (escaped: \\\\[ ... \\\\]) \\begin{equation} ... \\end{equation} (unnumbered: \\begin{equation*} ... \\end{equation*}) \\begin{align} ... \\end{align} (unnumbered: \\begin{align*} ... \\end{align*}) \\begin{alignat} ... \\end{alignat} (unnumbered: \\begin{alignat*} ... \\end{alignat*}) \\begin{gather} ... \\end{gather} (unnumbered: \\begin{gather*} ... \\end{gather*}) \\begin{CD} ... \\end{CD} For example: $$ c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$ \\\\[ f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d \\xi \\\\] \\begin{equation*} \\rho \\frac{\\mathrm{D} \\mathbf{v}}{\\mathrm{D} t}=\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbb{P}+\\rho \\mathbf{f} \\end{equation*} \\begin{equation} \\mathbf{E}=\\sum_{i} \\mathbf{E}\\_{i}=\\mathbf{E}\\_{1}+\\mathbf{E}\\_{2}+\\mathbf{E}_{3}+\\cdots \\end{equation} \\begin{align} a\u0026=b+c \\\\\\\\ d+e\u0026=f \\end{align} \\begin{alignat}{2} 10\u0026x+\u00263\u0026y = 2 \\\\\\\\ 3\u0026x+\u002613\u0026y = 4 \\end{alignat} \\begin{gather} a=b \\\\\\\\ e=b+c \\end{gather} \\begin{CD} A @\u003ea\\\u003e\u003e B \\\\\\\\ @VbVV @AAcA \\\\\\\\ C @= D \\end{CD} The rendered output looks like this: $$ c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$ \\[ f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d \\xi \\] \\begin{equation*} \\rho \\frac{\\mathrm{D} \\mathbf{v}}{\\mathrm{D} t}=\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbb{P}+\\rho \\mathbf{f} \\end{equation*} \\begin{equation} \\mathbf{E}=\\sum_{i} \\mathbf{E}_{i}=\\mathbf{E}_{1}+\\mathbf{E}_{2}+\\mathbf{E}_{3}+\\cdots \\end{equation} \\begin{align} a\u0026=b+c \\\\ d+e\u0026=f \\end{align} \\begin{alignat}{2} 10\u0026x+\u00263\u0026y = 2 \\\\ 3\u0026x+\u002613\u0026y = 4 \\end{alignat} \\begin{gather} a=b \\\\ e=b+c \\end{gather} \\begin{CD} A @\u003ea\u003e\u003e B \\\\ @VbVV @AAcA \\\\ C @= D \\end{CD} Tip\rYou can add more inline and block delimiters in your site configuration.\rCopy-tex Copy-tex is an extension for $\\KaTeX$.
